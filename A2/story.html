        <p class="mb-5">Rapunzel was a beautiful girl with long, golden hair. She was taken away from her parents as a baby by a wicked witch and locked in a tower that had no door — only a window at the top.</p>
        <p class="mb-5">Each day, the witch would call out, <span class="italic">“Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down your hair,”</span> and Rapunzel would lower her hair out the window so the witch could climb up.</p>

        <p class="mb-5">One day, a prince heard Rapunzel singing. He came back often to listen and eventually climbed the tower using her hair, just like the witch. They fell in love, and he planned to rescue her.</p>
        <p class="mb-5">But the witch discovered their secret. In anger, she cut off Rapunzel's hair and banished her to a faraway desert. When the prince returned, he was tricked by the witch and fell, losing his sight.</p>
        <p class="mb-5">After wandering blind for months, he finally heard Rapunzel’s voice again. Her tears of joy healed his eyes, and they lived happily ever after.</p>
