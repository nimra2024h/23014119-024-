        <h2>The Complete Story of Rapunzel</h2>
        <p>Once upon a time, a poor couple lived near a walled garden owned by a wicked witch. The wife, pregnant and craving a herb called rapunzel, begged her husband to get some. He climbed into the garden and stole it, but was caught by the witch.</p>
        <p>In exchange for forgiveness, the witch demanded their child. When the baby girl was born, she took her and named her Rapunzel. As she grew older, the witch locked her in a tower deep in the forest. It had no stairs or doors, only a window. When the witch visited, she called, "Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down your hair!" and climbed up her golden locks.</p>
        <p>Years later, a prince heard Rapunzel singing. Curious, he discovered how the witch climbed the tower and did the same. Rapunzel and the prince fell in love. They planned to escape, but the witch found out, cut off Rapunzel's hair, and banished her.</p>
        <p>When the prince returned, the witch tricked him. Heartbroken, he jumped from the tower and was blinded. He wandered for years, until he finally heard Rapunzel's voice again. Her tears healed his eyes, and they lived happily ever after.</p>
        <h3>Moral of the Story</h3>
        <p>Rapunzel teaches us the importance of love, freedom, and never giving up hope, even when the world seems impossible to escape.</p>
